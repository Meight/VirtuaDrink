# VirtuaDrink
Virtual reality &amp; 3D simulator of the effects of alcohol on the human body.

The user is put through the four following scenes in virtual reality.

### Scene 1: Immersion and intake of alcohol

The user is seated at a table and can cease glasses of different drinks with the controller, bring it to their head and act like they're drinking it. This has the effect of increasing their alcohol intake.

### Scene 2: Drink-driving

The user incarnates someone who decided to drive back home under the effects of alcohol. They are seated on the driver seat of a car and they have to try to drive it as the effects of alcohol increase over time, based on their alcohol intake in the first scene. Time frame is accelerated but real-life time factors are used, e.g. the rate at which alcohol gets digested and enters bloodstream. After a certain point, it becomes practically impossible to control the car which crashes.

Intended, controlled _cybersickness_ is used in this scene to bring the feeling of sickness to the other. This is made possible by the usage of a dedicated shader, with its parameters of displacement and blur being tweaked with respect to the current amount of alcohol in bloodstream.

### Scene 3: Post-accident scene.

The user survived with no harm but can walk (practically, teleport to avoid _cybersickness_) through the post-accident scene. There, an ambulance and the police are present, trying to rescue other people who were directly impacted by the accident the user caused.

The user can interact briefly with two victims, learn more about their background and their intended future, and how the user ruined it through the accident.

### Scene 4: Statistics about Quebec

A statistical scene where the user can view the main statistics regarding drink-driving in Quebec.

All scenes smoothly transition to the next one using a fading effect.
